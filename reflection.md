- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

I think Encapsulation helps with the object-oriented side of the programming and thinking of it in terms of how the different objects would interact with each other in the real world. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked that the readme had steps which kind of guided me through the process of what I needed to do in each of the files and I liked that the requirements files also kind of guided me in terms of what the instructions and goals were for this project. I also added an accessor in the passenger file which allowed for the print manifest to work more easily and format nicely. What didn't work was when I tried intially in the passenger class for board & get off car I was using the addPassenger method to also check if the passenger could board, which would cause errors and wouldn't let me check if my other methods worked too. But I realized that it was calling the add/remove method twice and fixed that issue. I would say definitely consistently use the java documentation and stack overflow seriously became my best friend for any errors I encountered.
